1. include text animation 
- grayu/offwhite mud and then my name would surface from the bottom
2. More color and gradient
3. change user cursor when visiting in desktop mode
4. Use shadow to create 3d effect on the texts
- the shadow is relative to the current time
- daytime: use day light, brighter (off white, blue tint)
- afternoon: slightly warm, brightest (white, yellow tint)
- evening: warmer and darker, less bright (orange, purple tint)
- night: cool and dark mode, least bright, can see stars (moon light, navy or dark green)
